# AWS-Test-S3--Glue--RDSinstance--IAM-securityGrups--Postgres-Lambda--API-RESTful

Vectorized Database (Pinecone, FAISS)|
|  (Stores vectorized data for similarity searches, for example, embeddings)|

Description of the Architecture:

- **Data Flow:**
- Crawler runs to discover and create tables in the Data Catalog from your data in S3 or RDS.
-The ETL Job in AWS Glue takes the cataloged data, transforms it, and loads it into PostgreSQL in AWS RDS.
- When the data in RDS is ready, AWS Lambda can be triggered by an external request or internal event to process more tasks (e.g., updates, notifications).
- API Gateway exposes a REST API that allows external clients to interact with data stored in RDS through AWS Lambda.
- External Clients can make requests to the REST API and retrieve results or trigger actions based on the business logic.
- **How It Works:**
- The AWS Glue Crawler discovers and creates tables in the Data Catalog based on data stored in S3 or RDS.
- The ETL Job processes the cataloged data, performs transformations, and loads the data into PostgreSQL.
- AWS Lambda can invoke the ETL Job or execute additional logic, such as processing events or scheduling tasks.
- API Gateway exposes a REST API that allows external clients to interact with the system, retrieving data or triggering business logic.
- External clients interact with the REST API to access the data stored in RDS and perform actions through Lambda functions.
- **Benefits of This Architecture:**
- Scalability: Services like Lambda and Glue scale automatically without needing to manage infrastructure.
- Decoupling: The system is modular, with each component performing a specific task (crawler, data transformation, API access).
- Fast Data Access: Data is available in PostgreSQL (RDS) for efficient querying and interaction.
- Automation: The ETL Job and Crawler automate data processing and loading without manual intervention.
